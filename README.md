# Sentiment-Analyzer.
This is a sentimental analysis that checks for the tweets fetched from Twitter using Python
This program analyzes tweets as positive or negative

I had previously chosen to use API keys but it had a limit of 100 per call. So I had to implement a loop to import more tweets but then the API reached its limit of calling 50,000 tweets per month.

Thus, I chose to download tweets in csv format. 

This is an analysis of tweets that are about Kenya Power
